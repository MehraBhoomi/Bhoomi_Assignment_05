# Challenge 01]  In this challenge, you need to implement a method that squares
#                passing variables and returns their sum.
# Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method.
#                    All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. 
#                    This problem can be broken down into two tasks:
# Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.
# Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.
# Sample properties 1, 3, 5
# Sample method output 35
# Coding exercise Create a class Point with three properties: x, y, and z.

class Point:

    def __init__(self,x,y,z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def sqSum(self):
        sum = 0 
        l = [self.x, self.y, self.z]
        for i in l:
            sum = sum + i**2
        print(sum) 
        return ""
    
sample = Point(1,3,5)
sample.sqSum()       #35







# Challenge 02] Implement a Calculator Class
#               In this exercise, you have to implement a calculator that can perform addition, 
#               subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#               Problem statement Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:
# Task 1
# ðŸ‘‰ Initializer
# Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2. Properties
# â€¢ num1
# â€¢ num2
# Task 2
# ðŸ‘‰ Methods
# â€¢ add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
# â€¢ multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.
# Input - Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.
# Output - addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

# Sample input
# obj = Calculator(10, 94)
# obj.add()
# obj.subtract()
# obj.multiply()
# obj.divide()

# Challenge 03] Implement the Complete Student Class
#               In this challenge, you will implement a student class
#               Problem statement
# Implement the complete Student class by completing the tasks below
# Task
# ðŸ‘‰ Implement the following properties as private:
# â€¢ name
# â€¢ rollNumber
# ðŸ‘‰ Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above:
# â€¢ getName()
# â€¢ setName()
# â€¢ getRollNumber()
# â€¢ setRollNumber()
# ðŸ‘‰ Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation.
# Input - Checking all the properties and methods
# Output - Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters
# Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so.
# If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will
# also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly.

# Challenge no. 04] Implement a Banking Account
#                   In this challenge, you will implement a banking account using the concepts of inheritance.
#                   Problem statement
# Implement the basic structure of a parent class, Account, and a child class, SavingsAccount.
# Task 1
# ðŸ‘‰ Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.
# Account has the following properties:
#     â€¢ title
#     â€¢ Balance
# SavingsAccount has the following properties:
#     â€¢ interestRate
# Task 2
# Create an initializer for Account class. The order of parameters should be the following, 
# where Ashish is the title, and 5000 is the account balance:
# Account("Ashish", 5000)
# Task 3
# Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.
# Create an initializer for the SavingsAccount class using the initializer of the Account class in the order below:
# Account("Ashish", 5000, 5)
# Here, Ashish is the title and 5000 is the balance and 5 is the interestRate.

# Challenge no. 05] Handling a Bank Account
#                   In this challenge, you will define methods for handling a bank account using concepts of inheritance.
#                   Problem statement
#                   In this challenge, we will be extending the previous challenge and implementing methods in the parent class and its corresponding child class.
#                   The initializers for both classes have been defined for you.
#  Task 1
#    In the Account class, implement the getBalance() method that returns balance.
#  Task 2
#    In the Account class, implement the deposit(amount) method that adds amount to the balance.
#    It does not return anything.

# Sample input
# balance = 2000
# deposit(500)
# getbalance()
# Sample output
# 2500

#  Task 3
#    In the Account class, implement the withdrawal(amount) method that subtracts the amount from the balance.
#    It does not return anything.

# Sample input
# balance = 2000
# withdrawal(500)
# getbalance()
# Sample output
# 1500

#  Task 4
#    In the SavingsAccount class, implement an interestAmount() method that returns the interest amount of the current balance.
#    Below is the formula for calculating the interest amount:
#    interestAmount = (interestRate*balance)/100
# Sample input
# balance = 2000
# interestRate = 5
# interestAmount()
# Sample output
# 100
# Note: A new SavingsClass object is initialized at the end of the code and test results will be based on it.
# # #code to test - do not edit this

# # demo1 = SavingsAccount("Ashish", 2000, 5)   # initializing a SavingsAccount object
